java_dinamico
=============

Project to compile the Java Code dynamically.
==
To see how it works, run the test, on the src/test/resources there are four txt's files that contains the classes that will compile.
=
  To show this functionality: do change of formula on run time, to be easy and get focus on demonstration, we will use the four simple operations (add, multiply, subtract and divide) and to simulate the database, will have the txt file with Java's source inside. How cannot reference a class that was not created yet, we will make a interface to all classes on our “data bases” will implement it.
